Character Planner 0.2.0-beta.4 — tester release

To start, double-click CharacterPlanner.Desktop.exe. It opens the build editor; its
Simulate tab runs combat simulations against targets, with optional enemy fire,
repairs, shields and trigger-driven talents, within the model limits each result
lists. Keep the packs folder beside it: the app reads the game data from there.

CharacterPlanner.Cli.exe is the command-line version and answers every command in
JSON. Run "CharacterPlanner.Cli.exe describe" for its commands: catalog browsing,
build creation, editing, resolution, sharing, comparison, upgrade ranking and
simulation, the saved-build library, and live control of a running desktop window
(session commands). Builds are saved in %LOCALAPPDATA%\CharacterPlanner\alpha,
which both programs share.

Each program is a single self-contained file, with no separate .NET installation
required (Windows x64). On first start it unpacks a few graphics libraries into
%TEMP%\.net. Windows may warn that the program is unrecognised, because it isn't
signed.

The Division 2 pack is bundled with no game artwork. Its only images are eight
original slot images by Shade-Tech contributors (MIT); the app draws its own symbols
for talents, skills, specializations and items. release-manifest.json lists every
file in this archive with its SHA-256.

Changes since 0.2.0-beta.3 that move fight results:
- A burn or other status now ends when its enemy dies. Burn skills lose most of
  their damage against weak enemies that die quickly; tougher enemies show it less.
- Turrets and mines space their shots out instead of landing them all at once.
  Sniper Turret, Cluster Seeker Mine and Artillery Turret deal much more over a fight.
- Stinger Hive deals less: its stings share one status per enemy and draw on
  stored charges.
- Fights now reach Overcharge, through the Energize and Future Perfect talents.
  Overcharge from anything else is still a preview only.
- Skills cycle through deployment, duration and cooldown, and a skill's own status
  applies to its target.
Builds saved with an earlier beta open unchanged.

Also in this folder:
- ATTRIBUTION.md: where the game data comes from, its license and what the planner
  doesn't model.
- IN_GAME_CHECKLIST.md: readings testers can take to settle values the sources
  disagree on.
- CLI.md: the command-line guide.
- USER_ARTWORK.md: install a prepared artwork ZIP, preview credits, switch artwork
  or restore the bundled images. User artwork stays in local app data and isn't
  included in this archive or saved builds.
- ARTWORK_PACK_FORMAT.md: the standalone artwork ZIP contract for authors.
- LICENSE.txt and licenses/: this app's license, the game data's CC BY 4.0 license
  and the licenses and notices of every bundled library and font.
